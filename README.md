freeCodeCamp project.
After many hours going around and fixing bugs that appeared when I had fixed others, I finally managed to finish. 
I feel that in this work I strayed too much unnecessarily and lost too much time on easy things... :S

Anyway, I think it was a good training on the useEffect and useState hooks.
